Since we ignore size and aspect ratio, the hash should match any similar picture regardless of how it is stretched.\n(2) Convert the image to grayscale.\n(3) Compute the difference between adjacent pixels, creating the relative gradient direction. When shrinked to 9x8, the 9 pixels per row create 8 differences between adjacent pixels. \n(4) Assign each bits depending on whether the left pixel is brighter than the right pixel.
