# ImageHashes package

*ImageHashes.jl* is a Julia package for image hashing.
It covers various techniques to simplify the task of finding **exact** and **near duplicates** in an image collection, among other applications.


### Benchmark

The package provides basic benchmarks in `benchmarks/benchmark.jl `. One can run 

```
julia --project=. benchmarks/benchmark.jl 
```

to get 

```
BENCHMARK RESULTS
time taken to compute a hash using difference_hash : 1.28e-6 seconds
Hashes per second: 781645
time taken to compute 100000000 hash distances: 0.531 seconds
```

There is an equivalent benchmark in Python using 

```
https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash
```

which produces 

```
BENCHMARK RESULTS
time taken to compute a hash using dhash: 0.004 seconds
Hashes per second: 250
time taken to compute 100000000 hash distances: 242.927 seconds
```
